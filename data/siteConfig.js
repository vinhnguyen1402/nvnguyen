  authorDescription: `Passionate about web development, I began my journey in 2022, initially exploring the foundations of HTML out of pure curiosity. <br />
  In just my first year of professional experience, I transitioned from a support technician role to a frontend developer.
  During this time, I immersed myself in JavaScript and React, finding joy in crafting interactive and user-friendly web interfaces. <br />
  The continuous challenges and opportunities for growth keep my enthusiasm alive as I contribute to creating engaging web experiences.</strong><br />
  With all of my knowledge and experience, I will make every effort to contribute to the companyâ€™s growth, thereby making valuable products for society.`,
